I believe you are misunderstanding the situation. The miners are
willing to mine *any* transaction at *any* fee, if it means their
revenue increases (the altruistic behavior of the past is probably of
the past). If we allowed blocks to be infinitely sized, the miners
would mine all transactions always, as that would maximize their
profit.

This means users would have no incentive whatsoever to pay higher than
the minimum fee, because their transactions would be mined in the next
block anyway, regardless.

Note that user fees are currently ~11% of the total revenue of miners
(the remaining 89% being the subsidy), and this would have to rise to
~55% in 2020 at the next subsidy halving, to retain the current
pay-out of btc per block.

I'm not saying we must retain that amount for the miners, but I think
any changes to the fee system need to take this into consideration.

This concern weakly explains my initial claim that consensus revolves
around being OK to push users and economic activities out of Bitcoin: the
need to keep the total reward after the next subsidy halving.

I say weakly because the real value of the reward is not measured in BTC,
but in whatever currency the miners' electricity and equipment is valued.
Considering that, miners reward per block in the last year alone increased
tenfold, while not changing that drastically in total amount of BTC
received. If we then consider the hypothetical scenario where Bitcoin had
not driven users away, and maintained its economical properties of low fees
and fast transactions for the ever increasing demand for cryptocurrency, it
is quite probable it would still retain 80%+ of the total crypto market
cap, market that would be probably bigger now, with no civil war and the
flagship of the cryptocurrency growing at full speed. Miner's reward per
block would easily be worth 2 times what it is by now, although probably
with a smaller absolute amount of BTC. Extrapolating this scenario to the
halving in 2020, and assuming Bitcoin value wouldn't suddenly rise due to
lowered supply, miner count would probably drop, but drop to a value orders
of magnitude higher it will probably have by following this current path of
strangled growth.

Thank you for the discussion in reply, it is a complicated concern.


I realize now with further consideration of the article that I originally posted, uncapped block sizes may introduce a problem. Another person posted a similar idea as a proposed BIP to the bitcoin-dev list yesterday. My realization was that there may be nothing to stop a rogue or greedy miner from scooping all of the transactions in the transaction pool into the next block, scooping all transaction fees for themselves. Then, with all transactions processing into the next block, there would be no need to pay fees. That would be bad for Bitcoin. However, the other person seemed to suggest that it would not be economical to scoop all transactions. Due to the extra computational bandwidth required their block would not likely be the first solved so, there would be an equilibrium point where you scoop some transactions to solve the block first and get paid. If that is correct, fully uncapped block sizes at miners choice would still not quite work as the next block would then always contain one transaction only to be the first solved for the least computational power. What I suggested was that each transaction has a likelihood of being included in the next block and, what I supposed is that all transactions whose lucky number comes up then get included. This would still provide a random distribution of solved blocks amongst all miners. How what I foresaw could be enforced amongst all mining software to stop block underskimming by rogues and just solving one transaction (or one or, two transactions less) for a block which would likely be an issue, I do not know. If there was a block minimum size, why would anybody risk expending more computational power with less likelihood of solving the block?


A slight divergence on the topic of bad. IMO the current RBF implementation is bad. If store merchants operate on instant approval, as they would with EFTPOS and as we have seen already in implementations of Bitcoin at POS (not waiting for any confirms) then, a dishonest Bitcoin user could redivert the BTC back to themselves using RBF before there were any confirms and after they had already left the store. A solution would be to only allow RBF to replace the fee and not the whole transaction (replace with a higher fee). Another possibility would be for POS implementations of Bitcoin to not approve transactions with RBF set until there are confirms. The first does not introduce any additional issues but limits the possible uses of the RBF feature. The second would likely be problematic at POS - what to do if the customer pays with RBF set, have them take a seat for three to thirty days? Not an issue for online merchants where it is simple to wait for confirms - is Bitcoin actually seen as a live-in-store retail solution?

Just tested RBF - it already works much as I was suggesting it should, much different to what I saw described.

Subject: [bitcoin-discuss] Two questions on conversion to Segwit addresses
Message-ID: <c7987cb9-3688-d0ac-94a1-0443dd4f4c00@cannon-ciota.info>

Question 1 - Security of P2SH wrapped segwit
I am getting mixed information from multiple sources.
The claim is that P2SH outputs have only 80 bits of security. Some people claim that this only applies to mulisig P2SH addresses.
While others claims this applies to all P2SH outputs. I am aware of bech32 encoding which fixes this issue but bech32 is not supported by anything yet let alone any
hardware wallets. (No, not even Trezor supports bech32. People are saying Trezor supports bech32, this is only partial truth. The latest firmware update supports bech32,
but no wallet software exists yet which lets Trezor actually use bech32.)
Can someone inform if the security weakness of P2SH applies to all P2SH outputs including P2SH segwit addresses, or no? If P2SH wrapped segwit addresses are not affected, why?

Question 2 - How can people possibly convert to segwit?
To take advantage of the increased blockspace offered by segwit people need to switch to segwit addresses. But how is it even possible to convert to segwit if there is no
space available on the 1 MB chain to even convert to segwit? To even get a confirmation at current moment is unaffordable, especially if trying to merge multiple inputs.

Please enlighten me.
