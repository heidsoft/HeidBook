Release Note for aufs2-base5-2.6.27
J. R. Okajima
Feb 16 2009

This version of AUFS has several purposes.
- to be reviewed easily and widely.
- to make the source files simpler and smaller by dropping several
  original features.

Through this work, I may find some bad things in original source code
and have a chance to fix them. Some of the dropped features will be
reverted in the future, but not all I'm afraid.
If you are using AUFS currently and don't need the dropped features,
then I'd recommend you to use this version.

To Use This Version
- plain linux-2.6.27
- apply patches. all are essentially necessary except
  ecryptfs-2.6.XX.patch. if you don't use ecryptfs, then the patch is
  unnecessary.
- make menuconfig, and enable CONFIG_AUFS_FS
- build your kernel, install and reboot.
- build aufs2-util and install.
  + make variable: KDIR
    specify your kernel source path
  + make variable: DESTDIR
    specify your install path.
    some commands have to be installed under /sbin.
- almost all information about the CVS version are still valid,
  except the dropped features and below.

If you find something wrong, please let me know (or aufs-users ML). It
will be surely drive me ahead and really appriciated.
